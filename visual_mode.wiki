Nav:
With o or O in visual mode, the cursor jumps from the beginning to the end of the highlighted block, allowing you to expand the highlight area.


visual mode and command-line:
we can selectively apply command-line commands on highlighted text block. 
selecting few lines and runing :s/old/new/g will change old on thous lines to new

adding text in multiple lines:
	You can add text on multiple lines in Vim using the block-wise visual mode..
	by entring the block-wise visual mode and select the lines we need.
	the inserting text at the last select line by A(entre the text ater the cursor) or I(entre the text before the cursor).
	by exiting visual mode that adition will bw applyed to all selected lines.


selecting the last visual mode area:
	`<    Go to the first place of the previous visual mode highlight
	`>    Go to the last place of the previous visual mode highlight
	
nt: we can entre visual mode from insert mode using : ctrl-o v 

select mode

	Select mode emulates a regular editor's text highlighting behavior closer than Vim's visual mode does.
	In a regular editor, after you highlight a text block and type a letter,
	say the letter "y", it will delete the highlighted text and insert the letter "y"
