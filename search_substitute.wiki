in my vimrc we did set ignorecase smartcase , so that search will be case sensitive only in the case were there is an upercase in the search pattern . in case we want to search for a all lower case word of phrase we use \C to indecate that the search term will be case sensitive . ex: /\Chello : gonna search for only hello (ignore things like Hello , or HELLO ..)



//: repeat the last search.
\|: or 
/starting_pattern\zssomething\zeending_pattern: match the whole pattern exept for the zs ze but only highlight something
	
range search:
	[] used to sepecify the range of character you want to search for .
	/[a-o] gonna search for any alph between a and o .
	to do a negative search we can use [^] .
	nt: ^ outside the[] (/^) search in the firstb character in a line .
	
serach for repeating characters:
	we can pass count to our search (should be escaped)
	and it's placed after a single char we want to increment.
	* exact match \{\}
	* in range match \{m,\}
	* up-to match \{,\}
	* at-least match \{n\}
the count arguments \{0,\}(zero or more) and \{1,\} (one or more), are common search patterns and vim has special operators for them * and \+.

predefined character ranges:

\d    Digit [0-9]
\D    Non-digit [^0-9]
\s    Whitespace character (space and tab)
\S    Non-whitespace character (everything except space and tab)
\w    Word character [0-9A-Za-z_]
\l    Lowercase alphas [a-z]
\u    Uppercase character [A-Z]
