With Vim macros, you can record actions and store them inside Vim registers to be executed whenever you need it.

BASIC MACROS:
	qa                     Start recording a macro in register a
	q (while recording)    Stop recording macro
	@a    Execute macro from register a
	@@    Execute the last executed macros
	EXAMPLE:
		qa0gU$Gq
		this command will start recoding a marco in the register a (qa)
		goes to the begining of the line (0) and uppercase the from the current 
		location to the  the end of the line (gU$)
		then go to the end of the file (G)
	To replay it, run @a. Just like many other Vim commands, you can pass a count argument to macros

NT: Macro execution automatically ends when it encounters an error.

Command Line Macro:
	ou can also run :normal @a command line. :normal allows the user to execute any normal mode command passed as argument.
	 If you want to execute your macro between lines 2 and 3, you can run :2,3 normal @a.
